# Credit_Risk_Modeling
Credit Risk : The possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations.

The response variable we are trying to predict in this project is the loan_status, which can be 0, or a 1. 0 = non-default, and 1 - default.

### By analyzing historical loan data and identifying patterns and trends, a credit risk model can predict the likelihood of a loan default.This can help the business make informed lending decisions, reduce loan losses, and increase loan approval rates.
### A credit risk model can evaluate the creditworthiness of a potential borrower by considering factors such as credit history, income, debt-to-income ratio, and other financial metrics. This helps the business determine the risk of lending money to the borrower and set interest rates accordingly.

### In this project:
Exploratory Data Analysis.
Removal of outliers such as ages that are above 100, or employment length above 80 years.
pd.get_dummies to convert categorical variables into one-hot encoded variables.
Models used: Linear regression, and random forest classifier
